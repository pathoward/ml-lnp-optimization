An open source ML-leveraging program that suggests a four-component formulation to produce an mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticle (LNP) of a specific diameter.

### Vision
Code does 2 things: allow you to add/edit formulations based on formulation number, and return ideal formulation based on inputted material constraints and desired size
